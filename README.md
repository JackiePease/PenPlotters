For pen plotter work with @cheapjack and anyone else who's interested
I have an Eleksdraw which is currently at @cheapjack house and have borrowed an A3 laser engraver from @RussCoty which is at @doesliverpool. This needs to have a pen attachment.
Both need to have wax attachments for potentially creating microfluidics channels and batik patterns.
It may be that if more people from @doesliverpool want to be involved then this repository would be better placed under @doesliverpool
